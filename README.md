# Paradox's TG Bots
A bot(s) for telegram. Currently only has spurdo sparde, but other bots could be added easily.

Runs as a standard Elixir/Phoenix app, although you could also run it via the dockerfile included.

# Configuration
Currently, the bot has a few envars to be set
+ `TG_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Secret used by telegram to verify webhook origin integrity. Set to any suitably random value
+ `TG_TOKEN`: Token for the bot, generated by Telegram BotFather
+ `PHX_HOST`: Hostname of this server
+ `PORT`: Port to listen on, defaults to 4000. Reverse proxy or whatever you want
+ `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Phoenix requires this for sessions and cookies and such. I don't use em, but it still wants em.
